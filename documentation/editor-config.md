## Usage

For editor to have some necessary settings (for example space / tab indentation), it is possible to install `EditorConfig` plugin. Config file is included in the repository (.editorconfig).

This plugin is optional since Prettier will format files to achieve the same result, but it is still convenient for editor to have these settings applied too.

## Editor Integration: `Visual Studio Code`
