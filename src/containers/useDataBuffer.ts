 * Buffer of data with delay.
 * Data are in the format of array of string.
 *
 * Provides a way to delay inputted data before they are used.
 * Data can be preprocessed by preprocessor function, which processes inputted lines as programmer wishes.
 *
 * To add new lines, use addLines function. After that, they will be preprocessed with preprocessor function.
 * Each added group of lines is treated as a batch and outputted together.
 * Buffer periodically (with delay) checks if any new lines were added, and if so, it will add oldest batch of lines not yet ouputted.
 * Then, after delay, next batch will be outputted (if any), etc.
 *
 * @param delay - delay after which buffer outputs new data (if any)
 * @param preprocessor - function by which each added line is modified
